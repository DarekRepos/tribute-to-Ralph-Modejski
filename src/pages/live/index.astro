                He was <strong>born in Bochnia</strong> , then in Galicia, on January 27, 1861, to Gustav Sinnmayer
                Modrzejewski and actress Helena Opid Modrzejewska (best known outside Poland as Helena Modjeska).
            </p>
            <p>
                He was a <strong>classmate of Ignacy Jan Paderewski in Poland </strong> and was a formidable pianist
                in his own right.

                The son returned to Europe to study at l'Ecole des Ponts et Chauss√©es (<strong>the School of Bridges
                and Roads</strong>) in Paris, France. It was in 1883, while studying at Paris, that he obtained
                American citizenship. However, he always maintained contact with Poland, wrote much in Polish, and
                emphasized his Polish origins.

            <p>
                In 1885 he <strong>graduated from the School of Bridges and Roads at the top of his class</strong>.
                The same year, he married Felicie Benda; the couple had three children. He would later marry
                Virginia Mary Giblyn.

                Modjeski returned to America to begin his career, <strong>working first under the "father of
                American bridge-building,"</strong> George S. Morison. In 1893, in Chicago, Modjeski <strong>opened
                his own design office, which still exists as "Modjeski & Masters,"</strong> after it was joined in
                1924 by Frank M. Masters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modjeski's <strong>first project as chief engineer was the railroad bridge across the Mississippi
                River at Rock Island, Illinois</strong>. During his career, he served as chief or consulting
                engineer on dozens of bridges around the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                He took over the mis-designed Quebec Bridge after the 1907 disaster that killed 75 workers, and
                <strong>succeeded in creating the longest truss span in the world</strong> (though a construction
                accident killed another thirteen workers). It is still the longest cantilever bridge in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                He died June 26, 1940, in Los Angeles, California.
